# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the **instantiation process**. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A **class creational pattern** uses **inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated**, whereas an **object creational pattern** will **delegate instantiation to another object**.

## Scope
Scope specifies whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or objects. (Static vs Dynamic)

 - Class Creational Patterns
   - Class creational patterns defer some part of object creation to **subclasses**.
   
 - Object Creational Patterns
   - They defer some part of object creation to another object.
