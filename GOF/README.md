# DesignPatterns
I read lots of articles and books and I found the meaning of the design patterns in one sentence:
**Design Patterns solve common problems by providing typical solutions that have consequences and have trade-offs.**
# Design Patterns Criterion
## Purpose
So, In this criterion, It's reflects what a pattern does and most of the programmers use this criterion. In this criterion, patterns can have either creational, structural and behavioral purpose. 

 - Creational Patterns concern the process of object creation.
 - Structural Patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects.
 - Behavioral Patterns characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.
## Scope
Scope specifies whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or objects. (Static vs Dynamic)

 - Class Patterns
	 1. they deal with the relationships between classes and their subclasses through **inheritance** so they are **static-fixed** at **compile-time**.
	 2.  They are focus on **class** relationships.
   
 - Object Patterns
	 1. most of the patterns are in Object scope.
	 2.  They deal with **object-relationships** with can be changed at the **run-time** and are more **dynamic**.
